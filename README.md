# DanceGo project
## by Javardancers


Our project is divided in two parts: a rest api (back-end) and a a web app (front end).  
You can check the webapp here: https://javardancers.github.io/dancego-webapp/


It's a dance challenge all over the city (currently only available for Porto), where you can challenge your friends to a dance off.


You have 24h from the moment you start your challenge to check who the winner is.


Have fun! At least, as much as we did making this winner project :D
